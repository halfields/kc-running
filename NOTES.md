This Sinatra app will list running races in Missouri and Kansas

There will be two types of users: organizers and runners. Organizers must create an account and login to post information on a race they wish to promote on the website. Runners will not have to login. They can go to the site and peruse the posted race information.

I foresee 3 models: organizer, runner, and race.
